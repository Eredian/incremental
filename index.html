    <p>You see a world of ash hurtling towards you.
    <p>As the world nears you realize you will narrowly miss it. Relief.
    <p>As you graze the thick atmosphere of the planet, you feel yourself slowing down.
    <p>You end up in a lopsided orbit, moments near the grey gem, eternities far away.
    <p>Every moment you see a different portion of the sphere, learn more about it.
    <p>The moments lengthen, the eternities become more bearable.
    <p>You've learned all you can about your new home, you must land.
